    <h1>On-Campus vs Off-Campus Placements – Which is Better?</h1><br>
    <p>You enter college with lots of dreams and ambitions. There, you explore your interests, gain skills, learn fundamentals, and implement those in your projects. After completing graduation, now comes the time when you will be going to experience a transition in your career i.e., entering into the corporate world. But before this, you should have a placement offer in your hand. </p>
       <br>
       <p> There arise several questions such as, <b>Will I get placed or not? What’s the process for placement?</b>

        Getting placement is a process in which you apply for companies, give test rounds, and get selected or rejected based on your test. Placements are categorized into two types: On-Campus or Off-Campus Placements. Both have their own benefits and drawbacks as well.</p>
