                      A work placement for students refers to a monitored or supervised work schedule in an organisation. It allows students to experience the real-time “job” in a company. <br>
  
                      Almost always, an employer seeking to fill a vacant post for a particular job, asks for “experience,” apart from the required qualifications.
                      <br>
                     <b><u> Finding that perfect job</u></b> just after graduation can be difficult for students without work experience. That is why we stress the importance of work placements for students.

                      Proper placement makes the employee happy and reduces absenteeism and labour turnover. Proper placement increases morale and efficiency of the employees and builds a good relation with the employer. A candidate who passes all the steps in the selection process is then offered the job.
