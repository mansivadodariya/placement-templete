          With time, branding has evolved from mere newspaper ads to subtly pervasive methods that are classified by target markets, mediums of dissemination and choices that users make. And with his 25+ years of experience as a multi-dimensional industrial branding veteran, Hiten Shah cuts through the by zentine clutter of branding jargons to give decision-makers piercing insights into what needs to be done, to create the right stories and connect with the markets.
          <br><br>
          Over the years, Hiten has honed in on the dynamics of Brand Communication, and moulded his company, Brand Aid, to deliver tools that drive the evolution of brands in global markets. He and his team approach every industrial branding endeavor with a different strategic tactic, bringing only the right market-centric tools to the table; all the while remaining focused on delivering optimum value without straining financial resources of the clients.

Brand Aid Pvt Ltd may be a good company to work with. It requires a little more attention and research from your side, as they don't have reviews and portfolio items just yet.. Do your due diligence before contracting Brand Aid Pvt Ltd.
