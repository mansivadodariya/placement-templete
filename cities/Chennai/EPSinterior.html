          In the world of interior design illusion plays an important role, it doesn’t matter if you spend more money or less money. Maintaining balance is very important. 
<br><br>
          We have seen hundreds of projects who spent millions but failed in creativity. To overcome this issue interior designers follow certain rules. Some of the rules are 
          <br><br>
          <li>7 elements concepts</li>
          <li>Traditional Architecture like Zen, Kalinga, Buddha and so on</li>
          <li>Geographical Architecture like Indo, Arabic, Italian, European and American</li>
          <br><br>
          EPS Interiors have invested enormous human time to find the psychological benefits and its feasibility. As a result we bought some unique strategies and ideas to design your lovable living room.
<br><br>
          Here we would like to share some of the most important checklists for living room interior design.
          <br><br>
          <b>Maintain Negative Space:</b>
          <li>First and foremost thing you need to manage negative space is “Open Layouts”. Giving uniform space for our furniture and fitting is very important.</li>
          <li>As an architect, I always prefer to create an illusion and make the space more spacious. </li>
          <li>We implement a 7 element concept for every project we do. The concept will elevate the living room interior design to the next level.</li>
          <li>Too much positive or negative space will spoil everything. Our basic strategy is to maintain a balanced space which gives harmony for the home owners.</li>
          <br><br>
