<b>A New Employee Joins an Organisation – Guidelines to Managers:</b><br><br>

The organisational culture denotes the personality of the organisation- unwritten code of conduct and norms, interaction among members, the values which are shared and practiced by people through generations. Organisational culture may be expressed in many ways and include ceremonies, celebrations, rites, rituals, behavioural norms, language, jargons, beliefs and values.<br>
