   <b><h1>Placement – Meaning and Definition</h1></b> <p>
    When the candidate is selected for a particular post and when he reports to duty, the organization has to place him or her in the job for which he or she is selected which is being done through placement. Placement is the act of offering the job to a finally selected candidate. It is the act of finally assigning the rank and responsibility to an employee, identifying him with a particular job.
    <br>
    In the words of Pigors and Myers, “Placement is the determination of the job to which an accepted candidate is to be assigned and his assignment to that job. It is a matching of what the supervisor has reason to think he can do with the job demands. It is a matching of what he imposes in strain, working conditions and what he offers in the form of pay roll, companionship with others, promotional possibilities etc.” <br>
    A well placed employee will be an asset to the organization. Proper placement makes the employee happy and reduces absenteeism and labour turnover. Proper placement increases morale and efficiency of the employees and builds a good relation with the employer. <br>

Increased production, improved quality of the product, regularity in work and attendance indicate proper placement of an employee. It should be noted that, supervisor or an executive should always keep a watch on newly recruited employee to ensure whether an employee is properly placed or mis­placed. <br>
<b>Placement is an important HR function, and if properly handled, it does the following:</b><br>
1. Improves the morale of the employees
<br>
2. Reduces employee turnover
<br>
3. Decreases accident rates
<br>
4. Enhances labour productivity <br>
5. Clarifies expectations. <br>
After selecting employees, it is the responsibility of human resource management to place them on suitable job. A misplaced employee remains dissatisfied and may leave the job as early as he gets another opportunity. It is, therefore, important to familiarize the selected employees with the job, the company and other employees so that he feels comfortable and at home with the new step up. If employees are properly placed, inducted and socialized with the new job they will con­centrate on the job and give desirable performance.
