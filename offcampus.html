        <p>In this competitive society, it's crucial to get your dream career. So basically, there are two different ways in which students find the desired job. It is either through on-campus placements or off-campus placements. Off-campus placements are one of the ways to get the dream job for young graduates. In off-campus placement, the student will get a vast number of opportunities to showcase their talent. Off-campus placements can often be stressful and frightening and need extra effort to meet the recruiter and get selected in the company's selection process; hence factors like resume building, past work experience, etc. will play an important role in off-campus placement.</p>
