    <h3>The web development field is always evolving. It seems to be one of the most popular industries, and it’s not going away anytime soon, especially in light of the global pandemic. In light of this, we decided to compile a list of essential skills that every web developer should possess.</h3><br>
    <h2><u>What is Web Development / Who is a Web Developer?</u></h2><br>
    <h3><b>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites; it’s the work that goes on behind the scenes to make a website appear attractive, work quickly, and provide a consistent user experience. Web developers use a range of coding languages and frameworks to do this. The choice of languages and frameworks is determined by the tasks they’re performing and the platforms they’re using.</b></3>
    <h3><b>Web development talents are in high demand making it an excellent career choice. It is one of the most easily accessible and well-paying fields.</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Front-end development, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, and network security settings are all part of the web development process. Web development, in a wide sense, refers to all the actions, updates, and operations required to create, maintain, and administer a website in order to assure its optimal functionality, user experience, and speed.</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Web development is quickly becoming one of the most appealing in today’s times. But, what precisely is a web developer, and what does one do? A web developer or programmer is a person who converts a web design, which has been generated by a customer or a design team, into a website. They accomplish this by writing complex codes in a number of languages and frameworks.</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Web developers create the layout of a website, such as a visually appealing home page and a user-friendly design (frontend which is seen by the user), and they may also produce content for it. Developers ensure that a website is functioning on all web browsers after it is launched, testing and updating it as needed. A server, an application, and a database make up a website’s back end. A back-end developer creates and maintains the technology that enables the components that allow the website’s user-facing side to actually exist. They also use databases (a database is an organized collection of data) as they support better data access.</b></h3>
    <h3><b><u>The three main types of web developers are front-end, back-end, and full-stack.</u></b></h3>
    <h3><b>Front-end developers are in charge of the parts of a website that users see and interact with, while back-end developers are in charge of the code that governs how a website loads and functions. Full-stack developers do a little bit of everything.</b></h3>
    <h1><u>Web Developer Skills</u></h1>
        <h2><u>1. HTML/CSS</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/htmlcss.jpg" height="300" width="400" alt="htmlcss">
          <h3><b>To work as a web developer, you must be familiar with HTML and CSS. The standard markup language for constructing web pages is <b>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</b>  This language is widely used by <u>web developers</u> to create web pages.
            <b>CSS(Cascading Style Sheet)</b> on the other hand, is used to create the page’s layout, color, fonts, and style. Both of these languages are required to work as a front-end developers.</b> </h3>
          <h3><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), on the other hand, is a must-have <u> Web development</u>, as we previously stated. We utilize it to give our website a unique look, including the layout and design. We also utilize it to ensure that our website looks good on a variety of devices and screen sizes.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>2. JavaScript</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/javascript.jpg" height="250" width="200" alt="JS">
          <h3><b>Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is also mentioned while discussing the World Wide Web. Javascript is at the top of the list of necessary Web Developer skills and qualifications. JavaScript is a <u>programming language</u> that allows you to add complicated features to a website. When it comes to designing websites, knowing JavaScript will help you fulfill higher client demands. These abilities will enable you to construct highly interactive websites that prioritize user experience.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>JavaScript is a text-based programming language that allows you to construct interactive web pages on both the client and server sides. <u>Whereas HTML and CSS provide structure and layout to web pages, JavaScript adds interactive components</u> that keep users engaged.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>Developers can also use JS to create dynamic websites with particular features (manipulate elements, algorithmic thinking, and so on) that help build an engaging network on a digital platform. If you want to be a web developer, you can’t afford to skip JavaScript.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>3. Git</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/git.jpg" height="250" width="400"  alt="Git">
          <h3><b>A Web Developer can use a version control system to track, regulate, and revise code changes. Git is an example of a code versioning technology that allows you to quickly identify and rectify errors. The program allows you to keep track of the changes you’ve made to the code so you can go back and review it before making further changes. This is a must-have talent for a <u>full-stack web developer</u> working under tight deadlines.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>4. Backend Tech</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/backendskills.jpg" height="250" width="400"  alt="Back End">
          <h3><b>Web applications’ ‘behind-the-scenes’ functionality is handled by backend development languages. It’s the code that connects the web to a database, keeps track of user connections, and runs the web application. To deliver the final product to the end user, backend development works in collaboration with frontend development.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>Backend developers are generally concerned with the operation of a website. They write code that concentrates on the functionality and logic that drives the product they’re working on, and the technology they employ is never visible to consumers.</b></h3>
          <h3><b><u>The back end is made up of a mix of servers, apps, and databases.</u></b></h3>
          <h3><b>Writing APIs, writing code to communicate with a database, creating libraries, working on business processes and data architecture, and much more are all possible responsibilities for backend programmers. It is frequently dependent on the role and company.</b></h3>
          <h3><b><u>Object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming are two types of backend programming.</u> Java,.NET and Python are popular OOP languages. <u>SQL, F#, and R</u> are some of the most used languages for functional programming.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>5. JS Libraries and Frameworks</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/JS-Libraries-768x390.jpg" height="250" width="400"  alt="JS libraries">
          <h3><b>When you learn to program, you’ll discover that pieces of your code can be utilized in a variety of applications. There are a number of regularly used functions in JavaScript, for example.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>So why do they have to be written from scratch every time? This is where libraries come in handy. JavaScript libraries contain completed functions that an application can use to complete a task, as well as make programming easier. We can use libraries in CSS that already have classes that are regularly used.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>With frameworks, it is basically the same. The JavaScript framework is a JavaScript application framework that allows programmers to edit functions and use them as needed. Why build something from scratch if, by all means, you can use something and adapt it to your project? Frameworks simplify your work but give you a more standardized approach to coding. These frameworks also make it feasible for the programmer to create a device-responsive application. Some frameworks are Vue.js, React, and Angular.js.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>6. Testing and Debugging</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Testing-and-Debugging.jpg" height="300" width="400"  alt="Debugging">
          <h3><b>Debugging is the process of finding bugs, faults, or other irregularities in your code and then fixing or changing them. A software developer spends approximately 33% of his time debugging.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>You may need to check your website for mistakes on a regular basis. If any issues are discovered, you must be able to debug them. Regular testing ensures that the code is functioning correctly. As a result, becoming a successful web developer necessitates the ability to test and debug code on a frequent basis.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>This is a time-consuming and complicated process, but it is regrettably a necessary evil. Debugging becomes more enjoyable over time because it’s like solving a puzzle, and minor adjustments can make everything work.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>7. Search Engine Optimization(SEO) Skills</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SEO.jpg" height="300" width="500"  alt="SEO">
          <h3><b>Many clients prefer developers that are familiar with the basics of SEO. This is due to the fact that a website with effective SEO ranks higher in search results, attracting more visitors. Because clients frequently want to increase the number of visitors to their website, SEO is a valuable skill to have as a web developer.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>8. Responsive Web Designing Skills</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Responsive-Web-Designing-Skills.jpg" height="300" width="500"  alt="WD">
          <h3><b>Basic web designing knowledge is a major benefit. This is crucial because you will be given a design to bring to life on the web at some point throughout your journey to becoming a web developer.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>Understanding how responsive web design works is essential if you want to work as a web developer. A web page can be seen on a variety of devices with different screen sizes. Any website you develop must adapt to different screen sizes, whether they are using a desktop computer or a mobile phone. If the website you create isn’t responsive, it won’t work on either a desktop or a mobile device. As a result, you must be able to construct websites with responsive designs, as failing to do so may reduce the number of visitors to your siTE.</b></h3>
        <h2><u>9. Web Hosting</u></h2>
          <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Web-Hosting.jpg" height="300" width="400"  alt="Web Hosting">
          <h3><b>There are hundreds of website hosting providers to choose from, so the last thing you need to do is name your website after you’ve chosen one. When you choose a name for your website and want that name to be the address, you must register that name with a domain provider.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>Web hosting allows you to store your resources (HTML files, CSS files, JS files, photos, and databases) on a server and access via the Internet.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>After the web development process is completed, it must be made live so that users from all over the world may access it and generate traffic. Knowing how to deploy codes is required for this. Deploying your code entails putting it in the cloud, using SaaS providers like Amazon Web Services, and so on. Aside from deployment, understanding how to transfer and scale websites is also critical. These talents come into play if your project includes transferring from one host to another or adding new features or the ability to handle large amounts of traffic.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>Excellent problem-solving skills with excellent reasoning abilities are a requirement for all web developers, regardless of job title or job description.</b></h3>
          <h3><b>From addressing syntax problems and workflow loopholes to cracking an entirely new technique to install a unique website functionality, overcoming challenges necessitate these skills. If coming up with ideas is difficult, developers should at the very least be aware of where to go for potential solutions.</b></h3>
